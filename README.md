# 🕵️‍♂️ Pastebin Keyword Crawler
This Python-based crawler scrapes recent public pastes from Pastebin and detects mentions of cryptocurrency-related keywords (e.g., bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain) or Telegram links (t.me). It rotates proxies to avoid IP bans and saves relevant matches in a structured .jsonl format.
